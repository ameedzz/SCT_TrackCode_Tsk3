🎯 **TASK 3 COMPLETED!**
🐶🐱 **Built a Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using HOG + SVM**
💻 **SkillCraft Technology | Machine Learning Internship**

I'm super excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my **Third Task** as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology**! 🌟

---

### 🔍 What I Did:

As part of Task 3, I developed an image classification system that can distinguish between **cats and dogs** using traditional ML techniques.

✅ Extracted **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** features from grayscale images
✅ Trained an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier
✅ Evaluated model accuracy and visualized predictions
✅ Created an interactive **OpenCV GUI** to test new images
✅ Saved the trained model using **Joblib** for reuse

### 💡 What I Learned:

* Deep dive into **feature extraction** with HOG
* Hands-on with **SVM classifiers**
* Image preprocessing with **OpenCV**
* Practical understanding of building and deploying an ML pipeline
* Strengthened my **Python**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** skills
* How classical ML methods still rock with the right data! 💪
